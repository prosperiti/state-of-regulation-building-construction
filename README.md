There are 3 folders:
Raw Dataset: This dataset records building regulations across 11 Indian states and 5 Asian countries.
Analysed Dataset: This dataset compares building standards for industrial buildings in different states of India. The dataset provides a competitive view of how 10 states and GoI's National Building Code fare on standard-setting in factories.
Case Catalogue: This dataset catalogues 31 judgements by the Supreme Court (SC) of India. These 31 judgements give insights into the scarcity created by building and land-use regulations.
