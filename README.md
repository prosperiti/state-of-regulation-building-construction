# Repository for the State of Regulation Report 2023

## About the report
This report presents an inter-state comparison of restrictions on constructing industrial buildings and the cost of such restrictions. The report considers four building standards—ground coverage, setbacks, parking, and floor space index—across 10 states. States are then ranked on building restrictiveness for factories of different sizes based on average land lost to these four standards. In addition, the report also estimates the unit-level opportunity cost of these standards in terms of the rupee value of land lost and the number of jobs lost.

## Constituents of the repository
This repository stores the source material for the report and three datasets.

The source material includes three types of documents: the regulations studied in the report (both Indian and international), the source files for circle rates used in the report, and the 31 Supreme Court judgements analysed in the report. The source files for circle rates also include specifications about the location for which circle rates have been selected like distance from the city centre and jurisdiction of the location. 

The three datasets are:

<li>Raw dataset that records standards as written in law.
<li>Analysed dataset that records land lost and opportunity cost calculations for micro, small, medium, large, and mega factories.
<li>Case catalogue of 31 construction-related disputes decided in the Supreme Court over the last 10 years

## Naming convention followed
All documents are named using the following convention: <i>type of file_authority code_title of the document_year published/accessed </i>. There are 7 types of files: Regulations, judgements, circle rates, distance from city centre, jurisdiction, land use, and datasets. The authority code specifies a short hand for the relevant state or the court.
